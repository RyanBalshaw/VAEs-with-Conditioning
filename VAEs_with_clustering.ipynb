The problem here is that it is not given that a batch will have equal samples from each 'hidden class', so I am not sure how useful this will be when there are unequal spread in the classes.

VaDE tries to estimate $p(\\mathbf{y}=k\\vert\\mathbf{x})$ for each $\\mathbf{x}$ while CURL uses a batch-estimated posterior and effectively directly parametrises $q(\\mathbf{y}\\vert\\mathbf{x}) = \\prod_{k=1}^{K} \\gamma_{k}^{y_k}$, where $\\gamma_{k}$ is the batch estimated class likelihood. \n",

This leaves us with $\\sum_{k=1}^{K}q(\\mathbf{y}=k\\vert\\mathbf{x})\\left( \\log q(\\mathbf{y}=k\\vert\\mathbf{x}) \\right)$. What do we do with this? Well if we think about it a little, this is simply the negative of the entropy $\\mathcal{H}(q(\\mathbf{y}\\vert\\mathbf{x}))$, which can be considered as a cross-entropy loss. However, the difference is that we do not have labels and the labels, although they should be 1-of-K, will not be. Thus, it is better to leave it as the entropy. I believe Tensorflows softmax_cross_entropy_with_logits is better suited.\n",
        "\n",
        "At the end of the day, I think simply taking the loss at face value is the way to proceed, monitoring $\\mathcal{H}(q(\\mathbf{y}\\vert\\mathbf{x}))$ will be useful as this will tell us if any information is encoded into $\\mathbf{y}$, or if it is just left as is by the model. We want to minimize $\\mathcal{H}(q(\\mathbf{y}\\vert\\mathbf{x}))$, which the objective function does do for us when we maximise the ELBO (if you follow the signs for - $KL(q(\\mathbf{y}\\vert\\mathbf{x})\\Vert p(\\mathbf{y}))$), which is a positive.\n",

        "Assuming we have access to $\\log p(\\mathbf{z}\\vert\\mathbf{y})$ (which is a Gaussian, so of course we do), we can use the log-sum-exponential trick to calculate the denominator term. However, this will leave a log in the front of $q(\\mathbf{y}\\vert\\mathbf{x})$ (as we design it to be $\\log q(\\mathbf{y}=k\\vert\\mathbf{x}) = \\frac{\\log (\\pi_k p(\\mathbf{z}\\vert\\mathbf{y} = k)}{\\log \\left(\\sum_{k=1}^{K}\\pi_k p(\\mathbf{z}\\vert\\mathbf{y} = k) \\right)}$ and apply log-sum-exp to the denominator). Then, it is as simple to subtract the LSE from the individually weighted logarithms ($\\log (\\pi_k p(\\mathbf{z}\\vert\\mathbf{y} = k)$) and take the exponential of this function.\n",

        "In summary: $\\text{exp}(\\log (\\pi_k p(\\mathbf{z}\\vert\\mathbf{y} = k)) - LSE(denominator)) = \\text{exp}(\\log (\\pi_k) + \\log( p(\\mathbf{z}\\vert\\mathbf{y} = k)) - LSE(denominator))$. You will have to validate the numerical stability of this though... Check this [source](https://angusturner.github.io/generative_models/2017/11/03/pytorch-gaussian-mixture-model.html) which also does this and this [source](https://gregorygundersen.com/blog/2020/02/09/log-sum-exp/) which discusses it more directly.\n",
        "\n",
        "Some more things to think about (this is getting messy, I know): VaDE only needs expansion for the KL divergence between the categorical distribution, and you can use Gumbel-Softmax to stop the requirement for the loss to be sampled $K$ times! It effectively omits the $\\mathbb{E}_{q(\\mathbf{y}\\vert\\mathbf{x})}$ step. \n",
        "\n",
        "How does it work? It simply replaces the expectation over a discrete distribution with a continuous equivalent, which then allows us  to perform a Monte Carlo estimate, which just reduces to taking one sample. Very useful for the CURL method!\n",
